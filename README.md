# PiHomeAutomation

This will be the software behind a custom home automation and security system. The code here
is highly customized to the specific set of hardware being used, and not intended to be
general purpose. It is, however, free for anyone to use in any way they please, and should
be helpful for anyone attempting a similar project.

The following hardware will be used
* Raspberry PI Zero W
* MAX6675 Thermocouple
* DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
* Relay Board (made for Arduino)
* HC-SR501 PIR Motion Sensor
* MQ-2 Gas Sensor
* 4x4 Number Pad
* LCD 1602 Display

*Note: This project is under active development, may not be functional*
